-Definition
CASE WHEN
The CASE statement goes through conditions and return a value when the first condition is met
( like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result.

If no conditions are true, it will return the value in the ELSE clause

If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it return NULL.

-Syntax
CASE
	WHEN condition1 Then result1
	WHEN condition2 Then result2
	WHEN conditionN Then resultN
	ELSE result
END;
