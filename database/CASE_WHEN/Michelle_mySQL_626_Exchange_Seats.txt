LeetCode in MySQL 626. Exchange Seats - Michelle小梦想家 (English Version)


SELECT (CASE WHEN mod(id, 2) = 1 AND id = counts THEN id
			 WHEN mod(id, 2) = 1 AND id != counts THEN id + 1
			 ELSE id - 1
		END) AS id, student
FROM seat, (SELECT count(*) AS counts FROM seat) AS counts
ORDER BY id;


# declare counts
# (SELECT count(*) AS counts FROM seat) AS counts

# Rule
# 1. ID is odd number & id is equal to the count of # students, then id = id
# 2. ID is odd number & id is not equal to the count of # students, then id = id + 1
# 3. ID is even number, then id = id - 1
